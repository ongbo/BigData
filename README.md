All kinds of Components about BigData


Since 20th November,2018,I had got started with BigData.This is a very difficult comprehension.I spent a mouth studying MIT 6.824,and I finished my lab1.Time seems to be too long,because my english is no well and it needs to study a new laguange,Go.In that mouth,it just finished all kinds of RPC programs and Hash function......
Later,I learned Google's distributed Papers,they are Google File System which teach us how to store files in many computer and achieve high availability,scalable and consistency,BigTable which tell us how to query data in real time in a database,MapReduce about a distributed computing engine.
It's not enough.
